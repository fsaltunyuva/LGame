# L Game

A replica of the [game invented by Edward de Bono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_game) made in Unity.

"Is there an L that can be placed, and if so, how many possible positions are there and what are these positions?" algorithm is developed by [Alkım Doğan](https://github.com/doganalkim).

## Note

The game logic and necessary algorithms are done, but UI-UX developments are incomplete.

## TODOs

- [x] L Movement, Placability Check Algorithm
- [x] Turn System
- [x] Rotate and Mirror
- [x] Game Logic
- [x] Local 2 Player
- [x] Basic AI (Calculates possible moves and chooses one of them without thinking about winning, does the same for coin movement)
- [ ] L Mirroring Improvements
- [ ] Thinking AI (Try to win the game, current AI plays randomly)
- [ ] Difficulty Levels
- [ ] UI-UX and QoL Improvements
